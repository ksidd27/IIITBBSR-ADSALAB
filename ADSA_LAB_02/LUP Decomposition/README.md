# üî¢ LUP Decomposition in C

This repository contains a **C program** that performs **LUP decomposition** (also known as **LU decomposition with partial pivoting**) of a given square matrix.

---

## üìå What is LUP Decomposition?

LUP decomposition factorizes a square matrix **A** into three matrices:

\[
PA = LU
\]

Where:
- **L** = Lower triangular matrix (with 1s on the diagonal)  
- **U** = Upper triangular matrix  
- **P** = Permutation matrix (represents row swaps for numerical stability)  

This is very useful for:
- Solving systems of linear equations
- Computing determinants
- Matrix inversion

## üß© Code Explanation

### Functions

1. **`lup_decompose(double A[N][N], int P[N])`**
   - Performs LU decomposition with partial pivoting.
   - Finds a pivot row (the row with the largest absolute value in the current column) to avoid numerical instability.
   - Swaps rows in both the permutation vector `P` and the matrix `A`.
   - Applies Gaussian elimination to transform the matrix into `L` and `U` (stored together in `A`).

   Returns `0` if the matrix is **singular** (non-invertible).

2. **`print_decomposition(double A[N][N], int P[N])`**
   - Extracts the **L** and **U** matrices from `A`.
   - Builds the **Permutation Matrix (P)** using the permutation vector.
   - Prints **L**, **U**, and **P** matrices.

3. **`main()`**
   - Defines the input matrix `A`.
   - Calls `lup_decompose()` and checks if decomposition is possible.
   - Prints **L**, **U**, and **P**.
